Birds Canada ARU 2024
================

## Overview

The ARU data was collected by Birds Canada during 2024 breeding season
in the area of Chilcotin, Cariboo, BC, Canada. This repository contains
information for the data analysis contract and associated analysis
results.

## Tasks and outcome

The outcome of the analysis are: one .csv file containing the detection
of focal species during 2023 and 2024, and recommended BirdNET
confidence thresholds for selected target species. The duration of this
contract is between 2024 Sep. 1 to 2024 Dec. 31.

Detailed tasks as below:

- Analyze 2023 ARU data through BirdNET based on focal species (Birds
  Canada provided the species list)

- Analyze 2023 ARU data through BirdNET based on focal species (Birds
  Canada provided the species list)

- Conduct species-specific validation for 15 focal species

## Expected compensation

The total amount of the contract was calculated with an hourly rate of
\$40 CAD, and I expect the project to take around 180 hours (expected
hours with itemized tasks as below). This translates to a total cost of
\$7200 CAD. Detailed hours will be recorded while working and will be
communicated with the Birds Canada supervisor.

| Expected hours | Task |
|----|----|
| 8 | Data organization and documentation, collecting necessary information for the upcoming analysis |
| 16 | Analyze 2023 ARU data through BirdNET |
| 24 | Analyze 2024 ARU data through BirdNET |
| 4 | Produce one single .csv file for all analyzed data |
| 8\*15 | Species specific validation (15 species) |
| 8 | Communication (email, zoom call, etc.) |
